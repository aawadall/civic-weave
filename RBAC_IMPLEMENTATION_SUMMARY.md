# RBAC Multi-Role System Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with Projects, Volunteers, and Campaigns modules as specified in the plan. The system supports multiple roles per user and provides role-based navigation and access controls throughout the application.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Multi-Role Support**: Users can have multiple roles (many-to-many relationship)
- **Enhanced JWT Claims**: Include multiple roles in JWT tokens
- **Flexible Middleware**: `RequireAnyRole()` and `RequireAllRoles()` for granular access control
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy single-role system still supported

### 🗄️ **Database Schema**
- **RBAC Tables**: `roles`, `user_roles` for role management
- **Volunteer Ratings**: `volunteer_ratings` for thumbs up/down rating system
- **Campaigns**: `campaigns` table for email outreach management
- **Projects**: Renamed from `initiatives` with enhanced team management
- **Migration Scripts**: Complete data migration from old to new schema

### 🏗️ **Backend Implementation**

#### New Models & Services
- `Role`, `UserRole`, `VolunteerRating`, `Campaign` models
- Enhanced `User` model with multi-role support
- Renamed `Initiative` → `Project` throughout codebase
- Updated authentication middleware for multi-role support

#### New Handlers
- **Role Management**: CRUD operations for roles and user-role assignments
- **Volunteer Ratings**: Rate volunteers with thumbs up/down system
- **Campaign Management**: Email outreach with Mailgun integration
- **Project Management**: Enhanced with team lead features

#### API Endpoints
```
# Role Management (Admin only)
GET/POST    /api/admin/roles
POST        /api/admin/users/:id/roles
DELETE      /api/admin/users/:id/roles/:roleId

# Projects (renamed from initiatives)
GET/POST    /api/projects
GET/PUT/DELETE /api/projects/:id
GET         /api/projects/:id/signups
GET         /api/projects/:id/team-members

# Volunteer Ratings (Team Leads/Admin)
POST        /api/volunteers/:id/ratings
GET         /api/volunteers/:id/scorecard
GET         /api/volunteers/top-rated

# Campaigns (Campaign Managers/Admin)
GET/POST    /api/campaigns
POST        /api/campaigns/:id/send
GET         /api/campaigns/:id/stats
```

### 🎨 **Frontend Implementation**

#### Role-Based Navigation
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Show/hide menu items based on user roles
- **Projects**: Visible to all authenticated users
- **Volunteers**: Visible to team leads, campaign managers, admins
- **Campaigns**: Visible to campaign managers, admins
- **Admin**: Visible to admins only

#### New Pages & Components
- **Projects Module**: List, detail, create pages with role-specific views
- **Volunteers Module**: Pool view and scorecard system
- **Campaigns Module**: Campaign management and creation
- **Admin Module**: User and role management interfaces

#### Enhanced Components
- **AuthContext**: Multi-role support with helper methods
- **ProtectedRoute**: Flexible role-based route protection
- **Header**: Role-based navigation display

### 📧 **Email Integration**
- **Mailgun Integration**: Campaign email sending functionality
- **Bulk Email Support**: Send campaigns to multiple recipients
- **Email Templates**: Support for HTML and text email formats

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Role Structure
- **Admin**: Full system access, user/role management
- **Team Lead**: Project management, volunteer rating, team coordination
- **Campaign Manager**: Email outreach management
- **Volunteer**: Project participation, application management

### Key Features
- **Volunteer Rating System**: Simple thumbs up/down with comments per skill
- **Project Team Management**: Track signups vs active team members
- **Campaign Management**: Create, schedule, and send email campaigns
- **Data Migration**: Automatic migration of existing users to new role system

### Security & Access Control
- **Role-Based Routes**: Frontend routes protected by role requirements
- **API Authorization**: Backend endpoints protected by role middleware
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access data appropriate to their roles

## 🧪 **Testing & Quality**

### Code Quality
- ✅ **Zero Linting Errors**: All code passes linting checks
- ✅ **Successful Builds**: Both backend and frontend compile successfully
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript/Go type definitions
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ **Legacy Support**: Existing single-role system still functional
- ✅ **Data Migration**: Automatic migration of existing user roles
- ✅ **API Compatibility**: Existing endpoints continue to work

## 🚀 **Deployment Ready**

### Prerequisites
- Database migrations need to be run
- Mailgun configuration required for campaign functionality
- Seed script should be run to create default roles

### Migration Steps
1. Run database migrations: `make db-migrate`
2. Run seed script: `make db-seed`
3. Update environment variables for Mailgun
4. Deploy backend and frontend

### Environment Variables
```bash
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@civicweave.org
```

## 🎉 **Ready for Review**

This implementation is complete and ready for deployment. All features from the original plan have been implemented:

- ✅ Multi-role RBAC system
- ✅ Projects module (renamed from initiatives)
- ✅ Volunteers module with rating system
- ✅ Campaigns module with email integration
- ✅ Admin user/role management
- ✅ Role-based navigation and access controls
- ✅ Data migration and seeding
- ✅ Zero linting errors and successful builds

The system provides a robust foundation for managing volunteers, projects, and outreach campaigns with proper role-based access controls throughout the application.
