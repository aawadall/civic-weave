# Candidate Matching Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented an automated candidate matching and notification system for CivicWeave projects. The system matches volunteers with projects based on skills, notifies both candidates and team leads, and enables team leads to manage their projects.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Database Migration

**File**: `backend/migrations/009_candidate_notifications.sql`

Created a new table to track notification history and prevent duplicates:

```sql
CREATE TABLE candidate_notifications (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id UUID REFERENCES projects,
    volunteer_id UUID REFERENCES volunteers,
    match_score DECIMAL(5,4),
    notified_at TIMESTAMP,
    notification_batch_id UUID,
    UNIQUE(project_id, volunteer_id, notification_batch_id)
);
```

**Indexes created**:
- `idx_candidate_notifications_project_id` - Fast lookups by project
- `idx_candidate_notifications_volunteer_id` - Fast lookups by volunteer
- `idx_candidate_notifications_batch_id` - Track notification batches
- `idx_candidate_notifications_notified_at` - Time-based queries

### 2. ✅ Python Batch Job

**File**: `backend/jobs/notify_project_matches.py`

A comprehensive daily batch job (295 lines) that:

**Core Functionality**:
- Connects to PostgreSQL using environment variables
- Queries all projects with status 'recruiting' or 'active'
- For each project, finds top K candidates (default: 10) with match score ≥ 0.6
- Uses existing `volunteer_initiative_matches` table for fast lookups
- Filters out volunteers who aren't visible (`skills_visible = false`)

**Notification Logic**:
- Sends personalized notification to each candidate via `project_messages` table
- Candidate message includes:
  - Project title
  - Match percentage (e.g., "85% match")
  - Call to action to view and apply
- Sends summary to team lead listing all top candidates
- Team lead message includes:
  - List of candidates with match percentages
  - Encouragement to review profiles

**Duplicate Prevention**:
- Records each notification in `candidate_notifications` table
- Uses unique batch ID per run to prevent re-notifying same candidates
- Checks existing notifications before sending new ones

**Configuration (Environment Variables)**:
```bash
TOP_K_CANDIDATES=10          # Number of top candidates per project
MIN_MATCH_SCORE=0.6          # Minimum match threshold (60%)
SYSTEM_USER_ID=00000000-...  # System user for automated messages
DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD
```

**Output Example**:
```
=== Project Candidate Notification System ===
Started at 2025-10-13 09:00:00
Batch ID: abc123...
Configuration: TOP_K=10, MIN_SCORE=0.6
Found 5 recruiting/active projects

📋 Processing project: Community Garden (xyz...)
  ✓ Found 8 top candidates
    → Notified John Doe (85% match)
    → Notified Jane Smith (78% match)
    ...
  ✓ Notified team lead about 8 candidates

============================================================
Batch completed at 2025-10-13 09:00:15
Total candidates notified: 32
Total team leads notified: 5
============================================================
```

### 3. ✅ Team Lead Project Editing

**File**: `backend/handlers/project.go` (UpdateProject function)

**Modified Authorization Logic** (lines 212-258):

**Before**:
- No authorization check in handler
- Only middleware check for team_lead role (any team lead could edit any project)

**After**:
- Checks if user is authenticated
- Verifies user is admin OR team lead of the specific project using `IsTeamLead()` service method
- Returns 403 Forbidden if not authorized
- Allows editing all project fields (as per requirements)
- Adds comprehensive logging for audit trail

**Authorization Flow**:
```
1. Parse project ID from URL
2. Get user from JWT context
3. Query database: Is user the team lead for THIS project?
4. If not team lead AND not admin → 403 Forbidden
5. If authorized → Allow update
```

**Example Log Output**:
```
📝 UPDATE_PROJECT: User abc123 updating project xyz789
✅ UPDATE_PROJECT: Successfully updated project xyz789
```

### 4. ✅ Shell Script Wrapper

**File**: `backend/jobs/run_daily_matching.sh`

Executable shell script that:
- Changes to backend directory
- Creates Python virtual environment if needed
- Activates virtual environment
- Installs required dependencies (psycopg2-binary, python-dotenv)
- Loads environment variables from .env file if present
- Runs the notification job
- Provides timestamped output

**Usage**:
```bash
./backend/jobs/run_daily_matching.sh
```

### 5. ✅ Makefile Integration

**File**: `Makefile`

Added three new commands:

```bash
make job-setup-python       # Set up Python environment for batch jobs
make job-calculate-matches  # Calculate volunteer-project match scores
make job-notify-matches     # Notify top candidates about project matches
```

Updated help text to document the new commands.

### 6. ✅ Documentation

Created three comprehensive documentation files:

#### `CANDIDATE_MATCHING_SETUP.md`
- Complete setup instructions
- Configuration guide
- Testing procedures
- Monitoring queries
- Troubleshooting guide
- API endpoint reference
- Future enhancement ideas

#### `backend/jobs/README.md`
- Overview of all batch jobs
- Configuration options

- Docker setup instructions
- Monitoring and troubleshooting
- Example output

#### `backend/jobs/crontab.example`
- Ready-to-use cron configuration
- Multiple scheduling options
- Log rotation setup
- Monitoring examples
- Helpful cron syntax reference

### 7. ✅ Verified Existing Functionality

**File**: `backend/handlers/application.go`

Verified that volunteer application functionality already works correctly:
- ✅ Volunteers can apply via `POST /api/applications`
- ✅ Application status defaults to "pending"
- ✅ Duplicate applications are prevented (lines 105-109)
- ✅ Database trigger auto-enrolls on acceptance (migration 006)

No changes needed - functionality is complete.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Use Existing project_messages Table
**Decision**: Send notifications through existing messaging system rather than creating separate notification system.

**Rationale**:
- Reuses existing infrastructure
- Notifications appear in project message feed
- No need for separate notification UI
- Consistent with existing patterns

### 2. Top K = 10 Candidates
**Decision**: Default to notifying top 10 candidates per project.

**Rationale**:
- Manageable number for team leads to review
- Avoids overwhelming candidates with notifications
- Configurable via environment variable

### 3. Minimum Score Threshold = 0.6 (60%)
**Decision**: Only notify candidates with ≥60% match score.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures relevance of matches
- Reduces notification spam
- Based on cosine similarity scores from matching algorithm
- Configurable via environment variable

### 4. Batch-Based Duplicate Prevention
**Decision**: Use batch_id to track notifications and prevent duplicates within each batch.

**Rationale**:
- Allows running job multiple times safely
- Prevents spamming same candidates
- Maintains history for analytics
- Can adjust frequency without duplicates

### 5. Team Lead Full Edit Access
**Decision**: Allow team leads to edit all project fields for now.

**Rationale**:
- Per user requirements: "TL can edit all for now until we define workflow"
- Authorization checks project ownership, not field restrictions
- Easy to add field-level restrictions later if needed

### 6. Daily Schedule
**Decision**: Run notification job once daily at 9 AM.

**Rationale**:
- Avoids overwhelming volunteers with frequent notifications
- Morning notifications have higher engagement
- Matches score calculation runs hourly, so daily notifications are reasonable
- Can be adjusted via cron configuration

## Testing Checklist

### Database Migration
- [x] Migration file created with proper up/down scripts
- [ ] Run migration: `make db-migrate`
- [ ] Verify table created: `\dt candidate_notifications` in psql
- [ ] Check indexes: `\di candidate_notifications*` in psql

### Python Batch Job
- [ ] Set up Python environment: `make job-setup-python`
- [ ] Set environment variables in `backend/.env`
- [ ] Run calculate_matches first: `make job-calculate-matches`
- [ ] Run notification job: `make job-notify-matches`
- [ ] Check console output for success messages
- [ ] Verify messages in database:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM project_messages 
  WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC;
  ```
- [ ] Check notification tracking:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM candidate_notifications
  WHERE notified_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
  ```
- [ ] Run job again and verify no duplicate notifications

### Team Lead Authorization
- [ ] Create test project as team lead
- [ ] Update project as team lead (should succeed)
- [ ] Try updating project as different user (should fail with 403)
- [ ] Update project as admin (should succeed)
- [ ] Check logs for authorization messages

### Volunteer Applications
- [ ] Apply to project as volunteer
- [ ] Verify application created with "pending" status
- [ ] Try applying again (should fail - duplicate)
- [ ] Accept application as team lead
- [ ] Verify volunteer added to project_team_members

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Run Migration**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/arashad/src/CivicWeave
   make db-migrate
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment**:

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks
```sql
-- Check if job is running
SELECT 
    DATE(notified_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as notifications_sent
FROM candidate_notifications
WHERE notified_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(notified_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Weekly Review
```sql
-- Top projects by candidate notifications
SELECT 
    p.title,
    COUNT(cn.id) as candidate_count,
    AVG(cn.match_score) as avg_match_score
FROM candidate_notifications cn
JOIN projects p ON cn.project_id = p.id
WHERE cn.notified_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY p.id, p.title
ORDER BY candidate_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Monthly Cleanup
```sql
-- Remove old notification records (optional - keep 90 days)
DELETE FROM candidate_notifications
WHERE notified_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

## API Endpoints

### Project Management
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project (team lead or admin only)
  - **Authorization**: Must be team lead of the project OR admin
  - **Body**: Project fields to update
  - **Returns**: 200 with updated project, or 403 if not authorized

### Applications (Already Working)
- `POST /api/applications` - Create application
  - **Authorization**: Authenticated volunteer
  - **Body**: `{"initiative_id": "uuid", "message": "text"}`
  - **Returns**: 201 with application, or 409 if duplicate

### Messages (Used by Batch Job)
- `GET /api/projects/:id/messages` - Get project messages (includes notifications)
- `POST /api/projects/:id/messages` - Send message
- `GET /api/messages/unread` - Get unread count

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: No candidates being notified
- **Cause**: `volunteer_initiative_matches` table is empty
- **Solution**: Run `make job-calculate-matches` first

**Issue**: Database connection error
- **Cause**: Incorrect credentials in environment
- **Solution**: Check `DB_*` variables in `.env` file

**Issue**: Permission denied on shell script
- **Cause**: Script not executable
- **Solution**: `chmod +x backend/jobs/run_daily_matching.sh`

**Issue**: Duplicate notifications
- **Cause**: Multiple job instances running
- **Solution**: Check cron configuration, ensure only one scheduled

### Getting Help

1. Check logs: `tail -f /var/log/civicweave/notify_matches.log`
2. Review documentation: `CANDIDATE_MATCHING_SETUP.md`
3. Test manually: `make job-notify-matches`
4. Check database: Run monitoring queries above
