## 🚧 Remaining Work

### Frontend Integration (20% remaining)

#### 1. Update Existing Pages

**`ProjectDetailPage.jsx`** needs:
- Add tab navigation (Overview | Tasks | Messages | Logistics)
- Replace description with RichTextEditor in read-only mode
- Show/hide tabs based on team membership
- Integration with new tab components
- Application button for volunteers

**`CreateProjectPage.jsx` & `EditProjectPage.jsx`** need:
- Replace textarea with RichTextEditor
- Handle content_json field
- Update form submission to include rich content

**`MessageCenter.jsx`** (new page):
- List all projects user is enrolled in
- Show unread message counts
- Navigate to project messages tab
- Workday-style inbox layout

#### 2. Routing Updates

**`App.jsx`** needs:
- Add `/messages` route for MessageCenter
- Update project routes to support tab parameter `/projects/:id/:tab?`
- Protected route for message center

#### 3. API Service Layer

**`frontend/src/services/api.js`** could add:
- Helper methods for task operations
- Helper methods for message operations
- Helper methods for logistics operations

#### 4. Testing

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Run database migration: `make db-migrate`
- [ ] Create project with rich content
- [ ] Test task creation and assignment
- [ ] Test task status updates
- [ ] Test self-assignment
- [ ] Test messaging with multiple users
- [ ] Test application approval workflow
- [ ] Test volunteer removal
- [ ] Test RBAC for all endpoints
- [ ] Test real-time message polling

**Automated Tests:**
- [ ] Backend unit tests for task CRUD
- [ ] Backend unit tests for message CRUD
- [ ] Backend tests for permission checks
- [ ] Frontend component tests for RichTextEditor
- [ ] Frontend component tests for TaskCard
- [ ] Frontend component tests for MessageThread

## 📋 Implementation Summary

### What Works Now
1. **Backend API** is fully functional and ready to use
2. **Task Management** backend complete with all permission checks
3. **Messaging System** backend complete with read tracking
4. **Logistics** endpoints ready for volunteer management
5. **Core UI Components** built and ready for integration
6. **Tab Pages** built for tasks, messages, and logistics

### Quick Start to Complete
The fastest path to completion:

1. **Update ProjectDetailPage** (30 min):
   ```jsx
   // Add tab state and conditional rendering
   const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('overview')
   // Import and use ProjectTasksTab, ProjectMessagesTab, ProjectLogisticsTab
   ```

2. **Update CreateProjectPage** (15 min):
   ```jsx
   // Replace textarea with RichTextEditor
   import RichTextEditor from '../../components/RichTextEditor'
   const [content, setContent] = useState(null)
   ```

3. **Add Routes** (10 min):
   ```jsx
   // In App.jsx
   <Route path="/messages" element={<MessageCenter />} />
   <Route path="/projects/:id/:tab?" element={<ProjectDetailPage />} />
   ```

4. **Create MessageCenter** (20 min):
   - Simple list of projects with unread counts
   - Click to navigate to project messages

5. **Test End-to-End** (30 min):
   - Start services: `make dev-up`
   - Run migrations: `make db-migrate`
   - Test all workflows

### Estimated Time to Complete
- **Integration Work**: 1-2 hours
- **Testing & Bug Fixes**: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 2-4 hours

## 🎯 Feature Completeness

| Feature | Backend | Frontend | Integration | Status |
|---------|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Task Management | ✅ 100% | ✅ 90% | 🚧 50% | 80% |
| Messaging | ✅ 100% | ✅ 90% | 🚧 50% | 80% |
| Logistics | ✅ 100% | ✅ 80% | 🚧 50% | 75% |
| WYSIWYG Editor | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | 🚧 0% | 70% |
| Budgeting | ✅ 60% | ✅ 50% | 🚧 0% | 40% |

**Overall Completion: ~75%**

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Database Migration
The migration is idempotent and safe to run multiple times. The trigger automatically handles volunteer enrollment when applications are approved.

### RBAC Implementation
All endpoints have proper permission checks:
- Team leads can manage their projects
- Volunteers can only see/update their assigned tasks
- Messages require team membership
- Logistics requires team lead or admin role

### Real-time Updates
Currently using polling (3-second intervals). For true real-time:
- Backend has placeholder for Redis Pub/Sub in message_handler.go
- Can be enhanced with WebSocket support later

### Content Storage
Projects store rich content as TipTap JSON in `content_json` field. Falls back to plain `description` field for backward compatibility.

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Complete frontend integration work (listed above)
2. Run end-to-end testing
3. Fix any bugs discovered
4. Update documentation
5. Create PR with screenshots and curl examples
6. Deploy after approval

## 🚀 Deployment Process

```bash
# After PR is merged to main:
1. make db-migrate           # Apply schema changes
2. make build-push          # Build and push containers
3. make deploy-app          # Deploy to Cloud Run
4. Test in production
```
