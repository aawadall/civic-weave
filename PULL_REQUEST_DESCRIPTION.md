# 🚀 RBAC Multi-Role System with Projects, Volunteers & Campaigns Modules

## 📋 Summary

This PR implements a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system that supports multiple roles per user, along with three new major modules: Projects (renamed from Initiatives), Volunteers, and Campaigns. The system provides role-based navigation, access controls, and management interfaces throughout the application.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 🔐 **Multi-Role RBAC System**
- **Many-to-Many Relationships**: Users can have multiple roles simultaneously
- **Flexible Authorization**: `RequireAnyRole()` and `RequireAllRoles()` middleware
- **Enhanced JWT Claims**: Include multiple roles in authentication tokens
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy single-role system still supported

### 🏗️ **Projects Module** (Renamed from Initiatives)
- **Project Management**: Create, edit, and manage projects with team lead features
- **Role-Based Views**: 
  - Volunteers: Browse and apply to projects
  - Team Leads: Manage their projects, view signups, coordinate teams
  - Admins: Full project oversight
- **Team Coordination**: Track signups vs active team members

### 👥 **Volunteers Module**
- **Volunteer Pool**: Browse and search volunteers with filtering
- **Rating System**: Simple thumbs up/down rating with comments per skill
- **Scorecard System**: Aggregate volunteer performance metrics
- **Team Lead Features**: Rate volunteers and view performance history

### 📧 **Campaigns Module**
- **Email Outreach**: Create and manage email campaigns
- **Mailgun Integration**: Send bulk emails to targeted user groups
- **Campaign Management**: Draft, schedule, and track campaign performance
- **Role Targeting**: Send campaigns to specific user roles

### ⚙️ **Admin Module**
- **User Management**: Assign and revoke roles for users
- **Role Management**: Create and manage system roles
- **System Oversight**: Complete administrative control

## 🗄️ Database Schema Changes

### New Tables
- `roles` - System role definitions
- `user_roles` - Many-to-many user-role relationships
- `volunteer_ratings` - Volunteer performance ratings
- `campaigns` - Email campaign management
- `project_team_members` - Active project team tracking

### Schema Updates
- Renamed `initiatives` → `projects` throughout
- Updated foreign key references
- Added team lead and project status fields
- Enhanced project management capabilities

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
- **17 new files** created for models, handlers, and migrations
- **Enhanced middleware** for multi-role authentication
- **Mailgun integration** for campaign emails
- **Comprehensive API endpoints** for all new functionality

### Frontend Changes
- **12 new React components** for all modules
- **Role-based navigation** with dynamic menu items
- **Enhanced auth context** with multi-role support
- **Responsive design** with modern UI components

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

- ✅ **Zero Linting Errors**: All code passes ESLint/Go linting checks
- ✅ **Successful Builds**: Both backend and frontend compile successfully
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript and Go type definitions
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### Prerequisites
- Database migrations need to be run
- Mailgun configuration required for campaign functionality
- Seed script should be run to create default roles

### Environment Variables
```bash
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@civicweave.org
```

### Migration Steps
1. Run database migrations: `make db-migrate`
2. Run seed script: `make db-seed`
3. Update environment variables for Mailgun
4. Deploy backend and frontend

## 🎯 Role Structure

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full system access, user/role management |
| **Team Lead** | Project management, volunteer rating, team coordination |
| **Campaign Manager** | Email outreach management |
| **Volunteer** | Project participation, application management |

## 📈 Impact

This implementation provides:
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Role-based navigation and appropriate access controls
- **Improved Project Management**: Better coordination between volunteers and team leads
- **Volunteer Quality**: Rating system helps identify top performers
- **Communication**: Email campaigns for better outreach and engagement
- **Administrative Control**: Complete user and role management capabilities

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

- **Automatic Migration**: Existing users automatically migrated to new role system
- **Data Preservation**: All existing data relationships maintained
- **Zero Downtime**: Backward compatibility ensures smooth transition
- **Seeding**: Default roles and admin user created automatically

## ✅ Testing

- Backend compiles successfully with zero errors
- Frontend builds successfully with zero errors
- All linting checks pass
- Database migrations tested
- Role-based access controls verified

## 🎉 Ready for Review

This PR is **production-ready** and implements all features from the original plan:
