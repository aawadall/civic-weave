- **Go Services**: Complete skill management and matching services
- **API Endpoints**: Full REST API for skill taxonomy and volunteer/project skills
- **Python Batch Job**: Hourly match pre-calculation for instant lookups
- **Migration Script**: Data migration from legacy JSONB to taxonomy system

### 🎨 Frontend Components
- **SkillChipInput**: Modern skill selection with autocomplete and multi-mode input
- **ProfileCompletionModal**: LinkedIn-style completion prompts
- **VolunteerProfilePage**: Updated with chip-based skill editor and completion tracking
- **RegisterPage**: Optional skills selection with deferrable completion

- ✅ Pre-calculated matches for fast candidate lookups
- ✅ Efficient intersection-based matching

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Created:
- `skill_taxonomy` - Global skill catalog
- `volunteer_skills` - Volunteer skill claims with weights
- `initiative_required_skills` - Project skill requirements
- `volunteer_initiative_matches` - Pre-calculated match scores
- `volunteer_skill_weight_overrides` - TL weight adjustment audit trail

### Migration Path:
- Existing JSONB skills automatically migrated to taxonomy
- Legacy data preserved during transition
- Backward compatibility maintained

## 🚀 Deployment Steps Completed

1. **✅ Feature Development**: Complete implementation in feature branch
2. **✅ Code Review**: All components tested and validated
3. **✅ Merge to Main**: Successfully merged feature branch
4. **✅ Push to Remote**: Changes pushed to GitHub repository
5. **✅ Cleanup**: Feature branch deleted

## 📋 Next Steps for Production Deployment

### 1. **Database Migration** (Required)
```bash
# Run the new migration
make db-migrate

# Run data migration script (if needed)
go run backend/scripts/migrate_to_taxonomy.go
```

### 2. **Environment Setup** (Required)
- Ensure Python 3.8+ available for batch job
- Set up cron job for hourly match calculation:
  ```bash
  0 * * * * cd /path/to/civic-weave && python3 backend/jobs/calculate_matches.py
  ```

### 3. **Configuration Updates** (Optional)
- Update any environment variables for new endpoints
- Configure skill taxonomy seeding if needed

### 4. **Monitoring** (Recommended)
- Monitor match calculation job performance
- Track skill taxonomy growth
- Monitor profile completion rates

## 🔍 API Endpoints Added

- `POST /volunteers/me/skills` - Add single skill
- `DELETE /volunteers/me/skills/:skill_id` - Remove skill
- `GET /volunteers/me/profile-completion` - Get completion percentage

### Initiative Skills
- `GET /initiatives/:id/skills` - Get initiative skills
- `PUT /initiatives/:id/skills` - Update initiative skills

### Matching (New System)
- `GET /matching/my-matches` - Get volunteer's matches
- `GET /initiatives/:id/candidate-volunteers` - Get candidates for initiative
- `GET /volunteers/me/recommended-initiatives` - Get recommended initiatives
- `GET /matching/explanation/:volunteerId/:initiativeId` - Get match explanation

### Admin Features
